## Overview

**The Watchlist** is a single-page React app powered by TMDB. It focuses on *vibe* and *velocity*: quick discovery, smooth transitions, and a layout that reads like a film poster wall.

Whether you want something trending right now, a random charades prompt for game night, or a mood-based pick when your brain is done choosing—this app is built to keep you watching.

---

## Features

- **Trending & Popular Discovery**: Explore what’s hot across movies/TV.
- **Fast Search Overlay**: Type, scan, jump—no page reloads.
- **Mood Recommender**: Choose a mood, tune filters, and get curated results.
- **Charades Mode**: Generate movie titles as prompts (with language/genre controls).
- **Cinematic Details View**: Trailer links, credits, similar picks, poster actions.
- **Polished Motion**: UI motion via Framer Motion for a premium feel.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **React Router**
- **Framer Motion**
- **Lucide Icons**
- **D3** (for any data-driven visuals / UI support used in the project)

---

## Project Structure

High-level map:

- `App.tsx` — Router + layout shell
- `pages/` — Route pages (Home, Details, Recommender, Charades, etc.)
- `components/` — UI building blocks (Navbar, MovieCard, CustomCursor, Footer)
- `services/` — Data access layer (TMDB fetch helpers)
- `constants.ts` — Shared constants (image base URLs, mood/genre mapping)
- `types.ts` — Shared TypeScript types

---

## Routes

Core routes:

- `/` — Home (discovery/trending)
- `/recommender` — Mood recommender
- `/charades` — Charades tool
- `/about` — Creator page
- `/details/:type/:id` — Details page (`type` is `movie` or `tv`)
- `/category/:category` — Category collections

---

## Environment Variables

This project uses a Vite-style environment variable:

- `TMDB_API_KEY` — Server-side TMDB key for Netlify Function proxy (recommended)
- `VITE_USE_TMDB_PROXY` — `true` to route calls through Netlify function (default)
- `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` — Optional local-only fallback key for direct client calls

Create a `.env.local` file (or edit your existing one):

```bash
TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
VITE_USE_TMDB_PROXY=true
# Optional local fallback:
# VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
```

You can also start from the example file:

- `.env.example`

Important note: Any key used directly in client-side code can be discovered by end users. This app is configured to use a Netlify serverless proxy so your TMDB key stays server-side in production.

---

## Local Development

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2) Add your environment variable

```bash
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
```

### 3) Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Production Build

Build an optimized bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Vite outputs the final static site in `dist/`.

---

## Deployment Notes

You can deploy `dist/` to any static host:

- **Netlify**: `netlify.toml` is included. Set `TMDB_API_KEY` in Site Settings -> Environment Variables.
- **Vercel**: framework preset “Vite”, output `dist`
- **GitHub Pages**: also works; consider switching from `HashRouter` only if you configure SPA rewrites

---

## Troubleshooting

### Blank data / request failures

- Ensure `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` is set.
- If the UI loads but results are empty, check the browser console for fetch errors.

### CORS / image download

Some direct image downloads may be blocked by CORS depending on asset headers. The app falls back to opening the image in a new tab when direct download isn’t allowed.

### Port already in use

If `3000` is occupied, Vite will automatically try another port.
